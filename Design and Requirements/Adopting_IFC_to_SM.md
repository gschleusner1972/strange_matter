# IFC on Strange Matter

Strange Matter was born out of the needs expressed by the needs of both the
buildingSMART community for future versions of IFC but also the large community
around the build environment that is looking for a modern flexible way to
connect data.

Strange Matter is an open protocol for working with distributed, heterogeneous
data used before, during, and after all phases of design, construction and
operations of the of the built environment.

Strange matter is format, vendor, and tool agnostic.

It is a way for people, processes, and tools with different requirements working
together on design and construction projects to collaborate on data that has
distributed ownership, comes from different sources, and that is continuously
changing.

Strange Matter does this by providing a universal abstract concept of entity.
That is the thing that people care about (whether it is a particular building,
floor, facade, column, roadway, pile, rail bed, asset, or whatever) and for
which more or less data may be available to different stakeholders over
different periods of time, authored in different pieces of software.

Actual data is organized in components and relationships. Components are JSON
headers that refer to data payloads, which can be in any format a user or tool
generates. Relationships are defined in the same way as components, just without
payloads, and can describe any kind of semantic relation between two components.
A relationship between a component and entity is done by sharing a relationship
with an Entity ID component.

# Strange Matter Design Criteria

Strange Matter was born from the key requirements of the industry. Chief among
them is multiformat and multi standard support. It became clear that to reach
this goal the protocol use to organize data had to be standard agnostic.

Beyond that the actual data representation was informed by broad community input
most of which is captured here.

To allow for these two truths it looks reference the web when available but alow provide mechanisms to ensure that data collected in Strange Matter does not loose perminance if its web sources disappear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
