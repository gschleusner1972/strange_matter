# IFC on Strange Matter

Strange Matter was born out of the needs expressed by the needs of both the buildingSMART community for future versions of IFC but also the large community around the build environment that is looking for a modern flexible way to connect data.

Strange Matter is an open protocol for working with distributed, heterogeneous data used before, during, and after all phases of design, construction and operations of the of the built environment.

Strange matter is format, vendor, and tool agnostic.

It is a way for people, processes, and tools with different requirements working together on design and construction projects to collaborate on data that has distributed ownership, comes from different sources, and that is continuously changing.

Strange Matter does this by providing a universal abstract concept of entity. That is the thing that people care about (whether it is a particular building, floor, facade, column, roadway, pile, rail bed, asset, or whatever) and for which more or less data may be available to different stakeholders over different periods of time, authored in different pieces of software.

Actual data is organized in components and relationships. Components are JSON headers that refer to data payloads, which can be in any format a user or tool generates. Relationships are defined in the same way as components, just without payloads, and can describe any kind of semantic relation between two components. A relationship between a component and entity is done by sharing a relationship with an Entity ID component.

# Design Criteria

Strange Matter was born from the key requirements of the industry. Chief among them is multiformat and multi standard support. It became clear that to reach this goal the protocol use to organize data had to be standard agnostic.

Beyond that the actual data representation was informed by broad community input most of which is captured here.

| Data is assembled across many sources. It changes over time, has many versions and states. A single thing might be simultaneously in design, construction and operations all at the same time.                                                                                                      | Functional | Entity Component Model where the Components are Packets of Data.

| To describe the built world we need GIS, BIM, text, requirements, issues, inspections, lidar data, point cloud data, products, carbon, energy just to name a few. No format, standard etc. can ever describe all of this data so we need to find a way that can connect it without taking ownership |            | Strange matter is format, vendor, and tool agnostic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
