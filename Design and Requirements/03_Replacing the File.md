# Collections and Scenes

A collection does the work that files do in other systems.  But instead of containing the data it references the components, and thus components can be members of many collections.

## Archetype

In a system such as this, itâ€™s going to be important to externally define all the components that are necessary to complete a task, project etc.  An Archetype is a named set of these components.

## Ledger (WIP)

To quickly capture and enable a history of change the system will define how Ledgers can be used to capture change at a level more granular than is logical than components. 

## Cache (WIP)

It can be images that the raw data needs to be expressed as individual components, but for querying and fast accessing it can be imaged that the system will need a way to cache static data.
